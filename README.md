## Project Description

This project is used to identify the different types of triangles which includes Equilateral where all sides are equal,Isosceles where exactly 2 sides are equal,Scalene-where no sides are equal and the final scenario which is not a triangel-A triangel has three side of which two are equal.

##Specification-BDD
The program requires the user to input three values of which must be numeric values.

The program accepts the values then the user should submit so as to tell the type of triagle.

The program is able to identify a set of numbers that cannot form a triangle.This is because the sum of two of its sides are less than or equal to the other side.

The program is able to identify an isosceles triangle.This is because an it has two of its sides equal.

The program is able to identify an equilateral triangle which has all its sides equal.

The program is able to identify a scalene triangle.The scalene triangle has non of its sides equal to the other.In addition a sum of two of its sides should be greater than the other side.
